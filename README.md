# Online-quiz-portal
Made for college to take quiz by students.

You as admin/invigilator donâ€™t have to worry about keeping track of time during a quiz. This quiz can automate this for you, which saves a lot of time and planning for admin/ invigilator . You can set a timer for a certain time in which all attempts should be made. This is ONLY for participants who are invited to take the online quiz. You will see a timer at the top of the screen. This shows participants the time they have left to finish the quiz.

The quiz will automatically be save once the time limit is over. 

The participant can't cheat with timer as even if they restart the exam the time left is only shown to them, means timer will not restart. This added a plus one security to your quiz.
